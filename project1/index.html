I was walking down the street
        When out the corner of my eye,
            I saw a pretty little thing approaching me.
                    She said I never seen a man,
                            Who looks so all alone,
                            Oh, could you use a little company?
                            If you could pay the right price,
                            Your evening will be nice,
                            And you can go and send me on my way,
                                  I said you're such a sweet young thing,
                                  Oh why you do this to yourself.
                                        She looked at me and this is what she said.

Not even 15 minutes later,
      I'm still walkin' down the street
            When I saw the shadow of a man creep out of sight,
                  And then he swept up from behind,
                        He put a gun up to my head,
                              He made it clear he wasn't looking for a fight,
                                        He said give me all you've got,
                                        I want your money not your life,
                                        If you try to make a move I won't think twice,
                            I told him you can have my cash,
                            But first you know I've got to ask,
                            What made you want to live this kind of life?

Well now a couple hours passed,
      And I was sitting in my house,
            The day was winding down and coming to an end,
                  And so I turn to the TV,
                        And flipped it over to the news,
                              And what I saw I almost couldn't comprehend,
                              I saw a preacher man in cuffs
                              He'd taken money from the church,
                              He'd stuffed his bank account withÂ righteous dollar bills
                  But even still I can't say much
                        Because I know we're all the same,
                              Oh yes we all seek out to satisfy those thrills.
